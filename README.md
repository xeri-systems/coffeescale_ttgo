# Coffee Scale TTGO Edition
*** Work in progress !! ***
This is my first attempt at creating a coffee scale to improve my coffee making experience.

The code works but it is messy as and needs a cleanup.

TO DO:
- Tidyup the code
- Publish the hardware design and BOM
- Publish the 3D designs on Thingiverse/Prusa
-   Need to modify the enclosure to improve how the parts clip together
-   Probably need to remove the separate buttons...or not? Maybe keep to give more options...
- Documentation
- Add features 
-   Switch button layout.
-   Probably remove external buttons and use the ones on the TTGO...or keep both to allow for more features?
